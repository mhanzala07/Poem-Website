        A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue, <br>
        Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be, <br>
        Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece, <br>
        Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence. <br>
        <br>
        Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out, <br>
        Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt, <br>
        Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust, <br>
        Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet. <br>
